# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection and Classification

This repository contains a deep learning-based system for **automated detection and classification of brain tumors** from MRI scans, along with an interactive **web application** that supports real-time predictions and **generates downloadable diagnostic reports**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Early detection of brain tumors can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on MRI images to classify scans into tumor types or identify them as normal.

The web application allows users to upload MRI images, view classification results instantly, and generate PDF reports with diagnostic details.
